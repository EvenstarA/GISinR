This repo is for the Gis in R module for Honours at UCT 2025.

I have created an interactive map to display the species distirbution and occurrence of three protea chafer species within the City of Cape Town area using iNaturalist data. I have overlapped the observations with a shape file that shows the ecosystem threat status for City of Cape Town ecosystems, allowing for easy comparison between the species distributions and where they overlap with threatened ecosystems.

The interactive document can be sourced here: https://rawcdn.githack.com/EvenstarA/GISinR/78e7beed24e1c27b12037d989ab4e465ded7c355/Chafers.html
