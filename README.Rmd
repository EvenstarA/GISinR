## GIS in R 
Project for Honour's  GIS in R Module 2025. 

For this project assignment I will be assessing the ecosystem type within which invasive ant species in South Africa are located. 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
